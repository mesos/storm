Storm on Mesos
---------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mesos/storm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mesos/storm)

# Overview
Storm integration with the Mesos cluster resource manager.

To use a release, you first need to unpack the distribution, fill in configurations listed below into the `conf/storm.yaml` file and start Nimbus using `storm-mesos nimbus`.

The Mesosphere site has a tutorial which goes into more [details](http://mesosphere.com/docs/tutorials/run-storm-on-mesos/).

**Note:** It is **not** necessary to repack the distribution - the configuration is automatically pushed out to the slaves from Nimbus.

# Requirements
- Oracle JDK 1.7
OpenJDK 1.7 might work too, but that has not been tested.
The code was compiled with Oracle JDK 1.7 and will not work on Java 1.6.

# Building

Run build-release.sh to download storm distribution and bundle Storm with this framework into one tar release.

```shell
bin/build-release.sh
```

This will build a Mesos executor package.  You'll need to edit `storm.yaml` and supply the Mesos master configuration as well as the executor package URI (produced by the step above).

## Sub-commands

Sub-commands can be invoked similar to git sub-commands.

For example the following command will download the Storm release zip into the current working directory.
```bash
bin/build-release.sh downloadStormRelease
```
* `main`

  Build a Storm package with the Mesos scheduler. The output of this command can be used as the package for `mesos.executor.uri`.

* `clean`

  Attempts to clean working files and directories created when building.

* `mvnPackage`

  Runs the maven targets necessary to build the Storm Mesos framework.

* `prePackage`

  Prepares the working directories to be able to package the Storm Mesos framework.
  * Optional argument specifying the Storm release zip to package against.

* `package`

  Packages the Storm Mesos Framework.

* `downloadStormRelease`

  A utility function to download the Storm release zip for the targeted storm release.

  _Set `MIRROR` environment variable to configure download mirror._

* `dockerImage`

  Builds a Docker image based on the current packaged storm. Run ./bin/build-release.sh before running this subcommand.

* `help`

  Prints out usage information about the build-release.sh script.

# Running Storm on Mesos
Along with the Mesos master and Mesos cluster, you'll need to run the Storm master as well. Launch Nimbus with this command:

```
bin/storm-mesos nimbus
```

It's recommended that you also run the UI on the same machine as Nimbus via the following command:

```
bin/storm ui
```

There's a minor bug in the UI where it displays the number of slots in the cluster â€“ you don't need to worry about this.

Topologies are submitted to a Storm/Mesos cluster the exact same way they are submitted to a regular Storm cluster.

Storm/Mesos provides resource isolation between topologies. So you don't need to worry about topologies interfering with one another.

## Mandatory configuration

1. `mesos.executor.uri` or `mesos.container.docker.image`: Once you fill in the configs and repack the distribution, you need to place the distribution somewhere where Mesos executors can find it. Typically this is on HDFS, and this config is the location of where you put the distibution. Alternatively, you may use a Docker image in place of the executor URI. Take a look at the Dockerfile in the top-level of this repository for an example of how to use it.

2. `mesos.master.url`: URL for the Mesos master.

3. `storm.zookeeper.servers`: The location of the Zookeeper servers to be used by the Storm master.

4. `nimbus.host`: The hostname of where you run Nimbus.

## Optional configuration

* `mesos.supervisor.suicide.inactive.timeout.secs`: Seconds to wait before supervisor to suicides if supervisor has no task to run. Defaults to "120".
* `mesos.master.failover.timeout.secs`: Framework failover timeout in second. Defaults to "24*7*3600".
* `mesos.allowed.hosts`: Allowed hosts to run topology, which takes hostname list as a white list.
* `mesos.disallowed.hosts`: Disallowed hosts to run topology, which takes hostname list as a back list.
* `mesos.framework.role`: Framework role to use. Defaults to "*".
* `mesos.framework.checkpoint`: Enabled framework checkpoint or not. Defaults to false.
* `mesos.offer.lru.cache.size`: LRU cache size. Defaults to "1000".
* `mesos.offer.filter.seconds`: Number of seconds to filter unused Mesos offers. Defaults to "120".
* `mesos.offer.expiry.multiplier`: Offer expiry multiplier for `nimbus.monitor.freq.secs`. Defaults to "2500".
* `mesos.local.file.server.port`: Port for the local file server to bind to. Defaults to a random port.
* `mesos.framework.name`: Framework name. Defaults to "Storm!!!".
* `mesos.framework.principal`: Framework principal to use to register with Mesos
* `mesos.framework.secret.file`:  Location of file that contains the principal's secret. Secret cannot end with a NL.
* `mesos.prefer.reserved.resources`: Prefer reserved resources over unreserved (i.e., `"*"` role). Defaults to "true".
* `supervisor.autostart.logviewer`: Default is true, if not false please add 128M to `topology.mesos.executor.mem.mb`.

## Resource configuration

* `topology.mesos.worker.cpu`: CPUs per worker. Defaults to "1".
* `topology.mesos.worker.mem.mb`: Memory (in MiB) per worker. Defaults to "1000".
  * `worker.childopts`: Use this for JVM opts.  You should have about 25% memory overhead for each task.  For
  example, with `-Xmx1000m`, you should set `topology.mesos.worker.mem.mb: 1250`
* `topology.mesos.executor.cpu`: CPUs per executor. Defaults to "0.1".
* `topology.mesos.executor.mem.mb`: Memory (in MiB) per executor. Defaults to "500".
  * `supervisor.childopts`: Use this for executor (aka supervisor) JVM opts.  You should have about 25% memory
  overhead for each task.  For example, with `-Xmx500m`, you should set `topology.mesos.executor.mem.mb: 625`
