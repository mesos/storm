/**
 * Tracks the Mesos Tasks / Storm Worker Processes that have been assigned
 * to this MesosSupervisor instance.
 *
 * Serves as a bridge between the storm-core supervisor logic and the
 * mesos executor logic.
 *
 * Tasks are assigned or removed via either:
 *   Storm (storm-core supervisor) calling MesosSupervisor's ISupervisor interfaces
 *   Mesos (mesos executor driver) calling MesosSupervisor's Executor interfaces
 *
 * This abstraction allows the MesosSupervisor code to stay a bit tighter and cleaner,
 * while still giving the power to track the TaskID across deactivation of a port.
 * That allows calls through the Mesos interfaces to deactivate a port and then have
 * the storm-core supervisor see that the port is no longer active (via false return from
 * ISupervisor.confirmAssigned), and thus drives the storm-core supervisor to kill the
 * worker process associated with the port.

   * This method provides a way for Mesos (well, calls routed through Mesos to the Executor
   * interface implemented by MesosSupervisor) to kill the worker processes (mesos tasks).
   *
   * This works by changing the state of an existing assignment from active to inactive,
   * thus signaling to the storm-core supervisor that the assignment is no longer active.
   * And that works by the storm-core supervisor checking the active/inactive state via a
   * periodic call to ISupervisor.confirmAssigned(), which calls TaskAssignments.confirmAssigned().
   * Notably, we must retain *some* knowledge about the assignment despite it being deactivated,
   * namely the TaskID, so that when the storm-core supervisor calls ISupervisor.killedWorker()
   * we can send a TASK_FINISHED TaskStatus update to Mesos. That is required for Mesos to
   * learn of the task having been killed, otherwise Mesos would think the task is still running.
   *
   * NOTE: This isn't used *yet*, as we haven't spent time to code and test
   * MesosSupervisor.killTask() and MesosSupervisor.shutdown().
